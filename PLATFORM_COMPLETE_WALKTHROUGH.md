# 🎯 NEURAL SALVAGE - COMPLETE PLATFORM WALKTHROUGH

**Your NFT + Subscription Creator Economy Platform**

---

## 🌟 **WHAT YOU HAVE BUILT**

A **dual-monetization platform** combining:
1. **NFT Minting & Marketplace** - Permanent blockchain assets with royalties
2. **Salvage Yard Subscriptions** - Monthly recurring revenue from exclusive content

**Think:** Patreon + OpenSea + Arweave = Neural Salvage

---

## 💰 **REVENUE MODEL - THREE INCOME STREAMS**

### **Stream 1: NFT Minting** 💎
```
User pays: $4.99 per NFT
Your cost: $0.51 (Arweave storage)
Your profit: $4.48 per NFT (90% margin!)

Scale:
├─ 10 mints/day = $1,344/month
├─ 100 mints/day = $13,440/month
└─ 1000 mints/day = $134,400/month
```

### **Stream 2: Marketplace Fees** 🏪
```
Fee: 2% of every sale

Examples:
├─ User sells for $50 → You earn $1
├─ User sells for $500 → You earn $10
└─ User sells for $5000 → You earn $100

If 100 NFTs sell monthly @ $100 avg:
= $200/month passive income
```

### **Stream 3: Salvage Yard Subscriptions** 🔄
```
Fee: 10% of monthly subscriptions

Small (100 creators × 5 subs × $10):
= $500/month = $6,000/year

Medium (500 creators × 20 subs × $15):
= $15,000/month = $180,000/year

Large (2000 creators × 50 subs × $20):
= $200,000/month = $2.4M/year
```

### **TOTAL YEAR 1 PROJECTION:**
```
Conservative: $110,000
Realistic: $430,000
Optimistic: $2,200,000
```
