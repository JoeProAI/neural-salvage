## 🎤 **Practice Run** (2-minute version)

"Neural Salvage solves digital content preservation with three pillars: AI-powered organization, intelligent search, and permanent blockchain storage.

When you upload photos or documents, AI automatically tags and describes everything. You can search naturally - 'find sunset photos' or 'documents with my signature.'

For important content, we offer permanent blockchain minting. Unlike traditional storage that can fail or disappear, blockchain storage is distributed across 200,000+ nodes and lasts 200+ years. Users pay $2.99 per mint via credit card - no crypto knowledge needed.

The platform is fully functional with authentication, AI processing, payments, and blockchain integration. We're targeting creators, photographers, and anyone with irreplaceable content. The business model is simple: minting fees with 70-80% margins, plus future marketplace commissions.

Currently soft launching to beta users and building initial traction through creator communities."
