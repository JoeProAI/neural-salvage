## 📁 **FILE STRUCTURE**

After generation, your files should be:

```
public/
  icons/
    storage-icon.png      (512x512 or larger)
    energy-icon.png       (512x512 or larger)
    network-icon.png      (512x512 or larger)
```

## ⚡ **QUICK ALTERNATIVE**

If you want to launch faster, I can update the code to use Lucide React icons styled to match your theme instead of emojis. This is:
- ✅ Immediate (no generation needed)
- ✅ Professional looking
- ✅ SVG (scales perfectly)
- ✅ Consistent design

But custom AI-generated icons will be more unique and on-brand!

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. Generate the 3 icons using your preferred method
2. Save them to `public/icons/` folder
3. Let me know when done
4. I'll update the code to use them instead of emojis

---

**Want me to:**
- A) Update code for Lucide icons now (5 min, looks great)
- B) Wait for you to generate custom icons (30 min, more unique)
- C) Show you both options side-by-side
