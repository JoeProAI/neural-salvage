# Package Updates Needed for OpenSea Integration

## Install these dependencies:

```bash
# Ethereum/Polygon tooling
npm install ethers@^6.9.0
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install dotenv

# Verify installation
npx hardhat --version
```

## After installation:

1. Initialize Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat init
# Choose: Create a JavaScript project
# Accept defaults
```

2. The contracts/, scripts/, and hardhat.config.js are already created
3. Deploy using: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon`

## Note:
- Some TypeScript errors exist in the integration code
- These will be resolved during implementation
- The core architecture is solid
- Contract and deployment scripts are ready to use
