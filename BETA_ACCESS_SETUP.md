## Current Beta Users

Track in your own document or spreadsheet:

| Email | Granted | Reason | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| your-email@gmail.com | 2025-10-21 | Main dev | Unlimited testing |
| | | | |

---

## Firestore Security

Users **cannot** grant themselves beta access. The rules prevent this:

```javascript
// Users CANNOT modify beta fields
allow update: if request.auth.uid == userId
  && !request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasAny([
    'betaAccess',
    'betaGrantedAt',
    'betaGrantedBy'
  ]);
```

Only **Admin SDK** (server-side with your Firebase private key) can modify beta fields.

---

## Cost Savings During Testing

### Without Beta System:
- You hit 100 AI limit quickly
- Need to pay $10/month for Pro
- Every test costs API credits
- Hard to test at scale

### With Beta System:
- âœ… Unlimited testing
- âœ… $0 subscription costs
- âœ… Only pay actual API usage (Daytona, OpenAI)
- âœ… Can onboard friends for free

**Estimated Savings:** $10-50/month during testing phase

## When to Remove Beta Access

**Before Public Launch:**
1. Revoke beta from all test users
2. Keep beta only for:
   - Core team
   - Advisors
   - Strategic partners
   - Early investors

**After Launch:**
- Grant beta sparingly (VIPs only)
- Most users should convert to paid
- Use beta as marketing tool ("exclusive early access")
