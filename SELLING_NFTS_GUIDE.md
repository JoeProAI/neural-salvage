## 🏪 **BazAR Marketplace: How It Works**

### **What is BazAR?**
- Decentralized NFT marketplace on Arweave
- Trustless atomic swaps
- No middleman holding funds
- Direct wallet-to-wallet trades
- Automatic royalty distribution

### **Atomic Swaps Explained:**
```
Traditional Marketplace (Risky):
Buyer → Sends $ → Platform → Holds → Seller sends NFT → Platform releases $
                    ↑ Trust required!

BazAR Atomic Swap (Trustless):
Buyer + Seller → Smart Contract → Simultaneous swap
✅ NFT transfers to buyer
✅ AR transfers to seller
✅ Royalties auto-distributed
All in ONE transaction!
```

## 💵 **How to Price Your NFT**

### **Arweave (AR) Token Pricing:**

**Current AR Price:** ~$6-8 USD/AR (check live: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arweave)

### **Example Pricing:**

| Price (USD) | Price (AR) | Your Earnings (after 5% royalty) | Creator Royalty (3%) | Platform Royalty (2%) |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| $30         | 5 AR      | 4.75 AR (~$28.50)                | 0.15 AR (~$0.90)    | 0.10 AR (~$0.60)    |
| $60         | 10 AR     | 9.50 AR (~$57.00)                | 0.30 AR (~$1.80)    | 0.20 AR (~$1.20)    |

**Note:** BazAR also charges ~2.5% marketplace fee

### **Pricing Strategies:**

**For New Creators:**
```
Start low, build reputation:
- First NFT: 5-10 AR ($30-60)
- Build following
- Increase prices as demand grows
```

**For Established Artists:**
```
Price based on:
- Time invested
- Uniqueness
- Market demand
- Previous sales
- 25-100+ AR possible
```

**For Limited Editions:**
```
Scarcity = Value:
- 1/1 unique: Higher price
- Series of 10: Medium price
- Open edition: Lower price
```

   - Confirm transaction
   - Wait 20-30 minutes for confirmation

4. **Sell AR for USD:**
